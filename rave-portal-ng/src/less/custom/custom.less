/*
 * This is an example file where you can modify the style of Rave. It is suggested
 * that you look to rave-skin.less to see a list of styles that are available for modification.
 *
 * With that said, we discourage the practice of writing all of your styling in a single file,
 * as that is a difficult to maintain pattern.
 *
 * Instead, we suggest splitting up your style among multiple files and modifying rave.less to include all of the
 * your additional files.
