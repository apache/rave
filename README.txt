About
=====
Apache Rave is A new Web And Social Mashup Engine. It will provide an
out-of-the-box as well as an extendible lightweight Java platform to host, serve
and aggregate (Open)Social Gadgets and services through a highly customizable
and Web 2.0 friendly front-end. Rave is targeted as engine for internet and
intranet portals and as building block to provide context-aware personalization
and collaboration features for multi-site/multi-channel (mobile) oriented and
content driven websites and (social) network oriented services and platforms.
For the OpenSocial container and services the (Java) Apache Shindig will be
integrated. At a later stage further generalization is envisioned to also
transparently support W3C Widgets using Apache Wookie.

Release Notes
=============
