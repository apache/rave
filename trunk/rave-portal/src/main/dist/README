The binary release includes Tomcat 6 and four WAR files: Apache Rave,
Apache Shindig and Apache Wookie (Incubating) as well as sample demogadgets war. 

This is a self-contained release: you should be able to run Rave with no
additional downloads.

The binary distribution (.tar.gz or .zip) must be unpacked with the appropriate
tool. The minimum requirement for running the binary release is Java SDK 6+.
Rave should work on standard operating systems (Linux and Unix flavors
including Mac OS X; Windows Vista and 7).  

RUNNING TOMCAT

From the unpacked RAVE distribution directory, execute the startup script from
Rave's bin subdirectory, either startup.sh (linux/unix/osx) or startup.bat
(windows).

To shut down tomcat, run either shutdown.sh or shutdown.bat, also
located in Rave's bin subdirectory.

Tomcat logging and error messages are in logs/catalina.out.
Unix users can follow output with tail -f logs/catalina.out.

Tomcat by defualt uses the port 8080, if the port is used, an alternative port
can be specified in the conf/server.xml. Further details on this configuration
can be refered from http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/server.html.
